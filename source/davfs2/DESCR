Mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an
extension to the HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of
resources on a remote web server. davfs2 provides the
ability to access such resources like a typical filesystem,
allowing for use by standard applications with no
built-in support for WebDAV.
